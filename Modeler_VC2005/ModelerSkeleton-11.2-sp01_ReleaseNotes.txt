ModelerSkeleton-11.2-sp01 RELEASE NOTES

Eugene Hsu / ehsu@cs / 04-18-01

CHANGES from 11-sp01
--------------------

Modelerapp.cpp:

   Forgot to remove the m_modelerView from the Fl_Window.  This was
   causing very unusual crashes.  11.1 was a temporary fix by not
   deleting the old Fl_Gl_Window.

ModelerUi.*

   Added raytrace file output functionality.  By default, this outputs
   the scene from the *default* camera view.

ModelerView.*

   Added destructor to properly delete m_camera.  Removed drawing of
   camera axes.  Extended view frustum to 100 instead of 50.
